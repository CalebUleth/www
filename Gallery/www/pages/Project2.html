        Project 2 is actually this website. Now you may notice that this website is a bit, shall we say, different from the other ones. Noteably dispite the fact that you very clearly have left the homepage to view this page, you may notice that the URL is still the same.
        I assure you that I do infact have a unique HTML file for each page, though if you were to open Project2.html you would not get a webpage that looked the same as this.

        The reason for this is that this site was built with Framework7, which I learned in NM3630. Now Framework7 is actually designed to make mobile applications, so this would more accurately be described as a webapp opposed to a website. That said it is still made with HTML, CSS and js so I am going to argue that it counts
        Note that the projects button in the navbar was intended to be a normal drop down, but as is normal with HTML the button decided it did not want to display correctly. This pop out side thing is a workaround.
